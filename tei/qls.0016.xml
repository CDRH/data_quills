<note type="project">
<p>Turkey Vultures are the most commonly seen bird of prey on the northern Great Plains. With a wingspan larger than most hawks, the birds in flight, from a distance, may well incite an "ah" of appreciation from the casual observer, at the sheer majesty and ease of their marvelous soaring&#8212;unless the observer realizes that they're "buzzards," eaters of offal, attendants of the dead, and then said observer may shudder from a long-held human-cultural prejudice against these cleansers of the ecosystem. Nebraska poet (and U.S. Poet Laureate) Ted Kooser reiterates the stock reputation of this species, as death-dealing makers of "shrouds," but most of the poem is a re-appreciation that asks us to see them anew, as near-human ("fingers"), as artists ("sewing patterns"), and as casual (and social) loafers like many of us, "taking all the time in the world" as we/they go about the earnest business of living.</p>

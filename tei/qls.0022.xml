<note type="project">
<p>It's hard to admit that one of the first well-known "Midwest" writers could write such doggerel. Raised in part on Iowa and South Dakota farms, Garland happily (for all concerned) found prose fiction and non-fiction to be more his forte. The metaphor "doubt / Did not draw his sailing-chart" is fairly original, and maybe the highlight of the poem. But our bird eventually (and too blithely) becomes one of "us," a "true American"&#8212;that is, a bold and fearless traveler-hero. In fact, he seems more a prototypical <emph>cowboy</emph> than a bird; and when he dies in the penultimate stanza&#8212;folding "his feet up one by one" and turning "his last look at the skies," this modern reader envisions a cartoon cowboy in a Western farce. And thinks that this adventurous avian died two stanzas too late.</p>

<head>The Blue Jay</head>
<div1>
<lg>
<l>His eye is bright as burnished steel,</l>
<l rend="indent">His note a quick defiant cry;</l>
<l>Harsh as a hinge his grating squeal</l>
<l rend="indent">Sounds from the keen wind sweeping by.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>Rain never dims his smooth blue coat,</l>
<l rend="indent">The winter never troubles him.</l>
<l>No fog puts hoarseness in his throat</l>
<l rend="indent">Or makes his merry eyes grow dim.</l>
<l>His cry at morning is a shout.&#8212;</l>
<l rend="indent">His wing is subject to his heart.</l>
<l>Of fear he knows not&#8212;doubt</l>
<l rend="indent">Did not draw his sailing-chart.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>He is an universal emigre;</l>
<l rend="indent">His foot is set in every land.</l>
<l>He greets me by gray Casco bay,</l>
<l rend="indent">And laughs across the Texas sand.</l>
<l>In heat or cold, in storm or sun</l>
<l rend="indent">He lives unfearingly, and when he dies</l>
<l>He folds his feet up one by one</l>
<l rend="indent">And turns his last look at the skies.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>He is the true American! He fears</l>
<l rend="indent">No journey and no wood or wall</l>
<l>And in the desert, toiling voyagers</l>
<l rend="indent">Take heart of courage from his call.</l>
</lg>
